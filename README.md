## Sergio Enrech Trillo

_I've recently discovered coding, and fell in love with it._

An engineer at heart, my career has always been linked to technology. I have lived and worked in three different countries, worked for big and small companies, and even founded a startup in the business intelligence field.   
A few months ago, I discovered the joy of software craftmanship, and got absolutely infatuated with.  I am currently looking for exciting opportunities to get involved in Software development.

## Skills

-	**Self-starter and fast learner**: In my period as Telecom consultant in France, I worked for 9 different organisations in multiple IT and Telecom projects as external consultant. Every time I needed to hit the ground running, understand the technical requirements, but also the organisation culture, and deliver on the assigned task.

-	**Outstanding performance**: During my BT period, I got very good and outstanding marks in mostly all the quarterly evaluations, both in the “what” and the “values and leadership capability” sections

-	**Business and Financial acumen**:  Through inventory management and data analysis I achieved 90% unit cost reduction of leased circuits during a period of 3 years.
