## Sergio Enrech Trillo

_I've recently discovered coding, and fell in love with it._

An engineer by training, my career has always been linked to technology and IT, having worked in different countries and companies around the IT and Finance sectors.  I have created and managed a startup in the business intelligence field.  A few months ago I (re)-discovered the joy of software craftmanship, and haven't looked back since.  I am currently looking for exciting opportunities to get involved in Software development.

## Strengths

- A passion for coding, and technology in general
- Strong analytical skills
- Experience in complex multi-national projects, as well as start ups
- Business and financial acumen
